# Background Animations  
A series of HTML pages with CSS/JS animations.  
  
The purpose is to run these in full screen mode in a browser and screen capture for any amount of time you need.  
After capturing the screen (with Nvidia, AMD, OBS, etc), you can then use the video file as the background upon which you overlay other video.
